     * Overview: This class uses data abstraction to create a new data type "UserInfo", which is meant to store all temporary data inputs.
     * This allows for less lines of code when transferring data between scene in the GUI. 
     * This is a mutable class since the static variable "username" and "password" can be changed after the creation of the UserInfo.
